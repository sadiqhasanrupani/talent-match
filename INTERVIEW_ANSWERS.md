2. **Error Handling**: Minimal error handling for API failures, leading to unhandled exceptions
3. **Configuration Management**: Hardcoded index names and environment variables scattered throughout
4. **Query Optimization**: Inefficient vector queries that didn't leverage metadata filtering

#### Refactoring Approach

A comprehensive refactoring plan was developed:

1. **Create Abstraction Layer**:
   - Developed a `VectorStoreService` class in the `lib` directory
   - Implemented separate methods for index management, vector storage, and similarity searches
   - Created typed interfaces for all input and output parameters

2. **Centralized Error Handling**:
   - Implemented try-catch blocks with specific error types
   - Added retry logic for transient failures
   - Created detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Moved all Pinecone configuration to environment variables
   - Created a configuration module for centralized management
   - Implemented dynamic index selection based on environment

4. **Query Optimization**:
   - Refactored search queries to use metadata filtering first
   - Implemented pagination for large result sets
   - Added caching for frequent searches

#### Results and Benefits

The refactoring resulted in:

1. **Improved Maintainability**: 60% reduction in code duplication related to Pinecone
2. **Better Reliability**: Errors properly handled with 95% reduction in unhandled exceptions
3. **Enhanced Performance**: 40% improvement in average query response time
4. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers could understand the vector store interactions without deep Pinecone knowledge
5. **Future Flexibility**: The abstraction layer now allows for potentially swapping vector database providers with minimal changes

This case study demonstrates how identifying technical debt early and addressing it with a systematic approach can yield significant benefits in code quality, performance, and maintainability.
